## LauzHack 2017

Working on the [Openfood](https://openfood.ch) database, we are trying to see whether we can find some sort of impact on the climate of the same and if we canpredict from another dataset on the climate impact of certain ingredients, join it with the AR and make people feel guilty about it, or feel good about it (can we gamify it in any way? Gamification always wins in a way).

### Steps involved 

* Look at the dataset involved and extract the ingredients. In general, we have the different ingredients in the major Swiss languages, at least in German and French, and often in Italian and sometimes even in English. For the cases that we do not have the translations in English, we suggest to use the German or French names and try and translate it in English, with the help of the Watson API.

* Then we will try to find out, from the ingredients, a score that will give the climate impact of the food from the ingredients.
